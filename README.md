# GasStation

The Gas Pump Machine Processes Orders as follows:

1.  Customer must first insert a credit card.   If no card is scanned, no options on the screen are displayed and pressing any of the buttons on the screen results in a “Beep” audible alert.

2.  If a credit card is scanned, the screen displays a prompt for the customer to validate with a Zip Code.  If not validated, selecting the fuel type should not be allowed.

3.  If the credit card has been validated, the example screen to the left is shown.  The customer is presented with options (mapped to the button as shown) to either cancel the transaction or display help information.  If the customer wants to proceed, the customer would select the Gas/Fuel type (buttons not shown) and remove the pump nozzle to dispense gas.

4.  When pumping is completed, the customer inserts the nozzle back into the holder.  The display now shows a message asking if the customer wants to print a receipt.  Two options are shown, “Yes” or “No”.

5.  If the customer chooses “Yes”, a receipt is printed.

6.  The machine prints out a message “Thank You” after printing the receipt or after a timeout of 30 seconds.
